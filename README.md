# Reflection
In approaching software design for this project, I focused on planning the overall structure before diving into implementation. I first identified the major components of my 3D scene, such as the objects, textures, lighting, and camera controls, and then organized them into modular pieces of code. This helped ensure that my design remained flexible and maintainable. One new skill I developed during this process was learning how to think about user navigation and experience as part of the design process. Instead of simply rendering shapes, I had to design with intention, considering how the user would interact with the scene and how my design choices impacted performance and clarity. My design process followed an iterative cycle planning, prototyping, testing, and refining which mirrored a real-world development workflow. The tactics I used, such as modularizing code and emphasizing reusability, can be applied to future projects across different domains, since they help make programs easier to extend and debug.

When it came to development, my approach was rooted in building incrementally and testing frequently. Early on, I focused on creating simple shapes and rendering them successfully before moving on to more advanced features like textures, lighting, and camera navigation. A key development strategy I used was breaking down complex features into smaller, testable components. For example, implementing one type of lighting at a time before blending multiple types together. Iteration was central to my progress: I repeatedly refined my code and adjusted variables until the scene met my design goals. Over the milestones, my development approach matured. I moved from just “making it work” to thinking carefully about efficiency, readability, and scalability, which ultimately led to a polished final scene.

Looking ahead, I see computer science as a critical part of achieving my professional goals, particularly in becoming a software engineer. Computational graphics and visualizations have given me both technical skills and new perspectives. On the educational side, I now better understand how graphics programming connects mathematical concepts with real-world applications, which will strengthen my foundation for advanced coursework. Professionally, the ability to design and develop interactive 3D environments demonstrates not only technical expertise but also creativity and problem-solving qualities that are highly valued in the software industry. This project taught me how to balance technical rigor with user-focused design, a skill that I will carry into future projects, whether I am developing visualization tools, games, or applications requiring intuitive graphical interfaces.
